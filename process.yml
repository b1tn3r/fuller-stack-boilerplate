# .yml scripts can be used as configuration files for pm2 startup scripts, in which in this script we are creating a config to manage multiple applications
# These scripts can be written in YAML, JSON, or Javascript and a js sample process can be generated with 'pm2 ecosystem' to give a js config

# Run this script with 'pm2 start process.yml' and it will run the multiple applications or whatever process is configured

# Just a sample
